# AI Image Reminders - Feature Proposal

## Overview
A comprehensive Home Assistant package designed to help monitor and support ADHD individuals while parents are away. The system uses AI-powered image detection through security cameras to monitor household tasks and provide gentle, context-aware reminders.

## Core Features

### üè† Kitchen Monitoring System
**Purpose**: Ensure kitchen stays clean and food safety is maintained

**Features**:
- **AI Food Detection**: Uses Google Gemini to analyze kitchen cameras and detect food items left out on counters
- **Dirty Dishes Detection**: Identifies dirty dishes in sink, on counters, or other surfaces  
- **Smart Reminders**: Sends progressive reminders (gentle ‚Üí urgent) based on how long items have been detected
- **Independent Status Checking**: Can be queried at any time to get current kitchen cleanliness status
- **Customizable Sensitivity**: Adjustable detection thresholds and reminder timing

**Reminders**:
- Initial gentle reminder after 15 minutes
- Escalated reminder after 1 hour  
- Urgent reminder after 2+ hours
- Encouraging message when kitchen is cleaned

### üêï Dog Walking Monitoring
**Purpose**: Ensure proper pet care and exercise routine

**Features**:
- **Walk Detection**: Monitors front door/yard cameras and motion sensors to detect when dog is taken outside
- **Duration Tracking**: Automatically times walk duration using door activity sensors
- **Schedule Awareness**: Knows normal walking intervals (6-8 hours) and sends reminders accordingly
- **Independent Status**: Can check at any time if dog needs a walk and when last walk occurred
- **Emergency Escalation**: Special urgent alerts if dog hasn't been walked in 10+ hours

**Reminders**:
- Friendly reminder after 6 hours since last walk
- More urgent reminder after 8 hours
- Emergency-level alert after 10+ hours
- Congratulatory message after completed walks

### ü§ñ AI Image Analysis Engine
**Purpose**: Provide reliable, context-aware detection using existing Google Gemini integration

**Features**:
- **Leverages Existing Pattern**: Uses your current Google Gemini package delivery detection as a foundation
- **Multi-Camera Support**: Can analyze multiple camera feeds (kitchen, family room, front yard)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for detections to reduce false positives
- **Flexible Prompts**: Customizable AI prompts for different detection scenarios
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures or camera issues

**Detection Types**:
- Kitchen cleanliness assessment
- Food items identification
- Dirty dishes detection
- Human + dog activity recognition
- Movement direction detection (leaving/returning)

### üì± Smart Notification System
**Purpose**: Provide helpful, non-overwhelming reminders that respect ADHD needs

**Features**:
- **Progressive Escalation**: Starts gentle, becomes more urgent over time
- **ADHD-Friendly Messaging**: Breaks tasks into small, manageable steps
- **Context Awareness**: Different messages for different situations
- **Quiet Hours**: Respects sleep/rest times (configurable)
- **Interactive Notifications**: Action buttons for "Done", "Snooze", etc.
- **Encouraging Feedback**: Positive reinforcement when tasks are completed

**Notification Types**:
- Task reminders (kitchen, dog walking)
- Completion acknowledgments
- Daily summaries
- System health alerts
- Weekly progress reports

### üîß System Management
**Purpose**: Easy configuration and monitoring of the system itself

**Features**:
- **Manual Override**: Parents can disable/enable monitoring remotely
- **System Health Monitoring**: Alerts if cameras or AI system go offline
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Customizable active hours and reminder frequencies  
- **Test Functions**: Easy way to test notifications and detection
- **Status Dashboard**: Quick overview of all monitoring systems

### Integration Points
- **Google Gemini API**: For image analysis (using your existing integration pattern)
- **Home Assistant Cameras**: Your existing security camera setup
- **Mobile Notifications**: Home Assistant app or other notification services
- **Door/Motion Sensors**: For detecting dog walking activity

### Independent Operation
Each monitoring system can work independently:
- Check kitchen status without affecting dog monitoring
- Query dog walk history without kitchen involvement
- Manual testing of individual components
- Selective enabling/disabling of features

## Configuration Requirements

### Camera Setup
- Kitchen camera entity name
- Family room camera entity name (optional)
- Front door/yard camera entity name

### Notification Setup  
- Mobile device notification service name
- Preferred notification times/quiet hours
- Escalation timing preferences

### Sensor Integration
- Front door motion sensor (if available)
- Any existing pet-related sensors

## Benefits for ADHD Support

### Task Management
- **Breaks down tasks**: "Put away the milk" vs. "clean entire kitchen"
- **Visual confirmation**: AI sees what actually needs attention
- **Timing flexibility**: Reminders respect individual rhythms
- **Positive reinforcement**: Celebrates completed tasks

### Routine Support
- **Consistent monitoring**: Doesn't forget or get distracted
- **Objective assessment**: No judgment, just helpful observations
- **Pattern recognition**: Learns normal routines and adapts
- **Emergency backup**: Ensures critical tasks (pet care) don't get missed

### Parent Peace of Mind
